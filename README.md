# pomotui

I usually use a Mac toolbar application called [Flow](https://flowapp.info/)
to track my "working sessions" but I would like to build myself something
that has the same functionality

`pomotui` is built with Go and the [BubbleTea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
TUI framework

# pomotui

A TUI application for working with the [Pomodoro Technique](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique)

## why

I currently use a Mac toolbar application called [Flow](https://flowapp.info/) to work in with the Pomodoro Technique. This application is minimal, does exactly what is supposed to do and is a great choice

However Flow is:
- Closed source
- Only available on Mac
- Paid features that, I argue, are too essential to not be free

So I am building a replacement for all the terminal and open-source loving people out there

## tech

`pomotui` is built with:
- Go
- [BubbleTea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) TUI framework

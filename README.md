# pomotui

I usually use a Mac toolbar application called [Flow](https://flowapp.info/)
to track my "working sessions" but I would like to build myself something
that has the same functionality

`pomotui` is built with Go and the [BubbleTea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
TUI framework

## Features To Implement

- [ ] choose working duration (defaults to 30 min)
- [ ] choose working session count (defaults to 4, then long break)
- [ ] choose break duration (defaults to 5 min)
- [ ] choose long break duration (defaults to 15 mins)
- [ ] save & persist configuration
- [ ] start clock
- [ ] stop clock
